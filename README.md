# Ambiance-Reloaded
This is a repo looking for improve the default Ubuntu 16.04 Ambiance theme but keeping the default color schema. Please feel free to contrib with your own ideas.

## Manually Installation

Download the source to the theme here. If you are a developer or a designer, I also encourage you to contribute to it. Create a folder, called .theme in your home directory. This can be simply created by firing up your terminal, and then running

mkdir .themes

Now this is a hidden directory, to view this in Nautilus, you can press Ctrl/âŒ˜ + H. Alternatively, you can also place the extracted files in your /usr/share/themes/ folder.

Now use Unity-Tweak tool or Ubuntu Tweak tool for apply changes.

## Here some screenshots...!

This is a bit simple customization, but is just a beginning.
